# Racks

We are committed to trasnparency and open source for all case designs for the Xerxes Pi including our 1U mini rack, single Xerxes Pi enclosure, and full 19" 1U pro rack. All rack designs will be engineered to fit in a typically sized commercial 3D printer. All prints can either be bought by us pre-printed, printed on your own home printer, or printed by any of our print-farm partners.
