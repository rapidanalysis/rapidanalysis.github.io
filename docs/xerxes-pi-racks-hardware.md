# Racks

All rack designs will be engineered to fit in a typically sized commercial 3D printer. All prints can either be bought by us pre-printed, printed on your own home printer, or printed by any of our print-farm partners. 

::: tip
All our final 3D print models can be found at Printables, for single prints, or Makerworld, for large volume arrangements of our models.

## Full Size 19 inch 1U Rack

A full sized 19 inch rack mount for enclosing a cluster of 12 Xerxes Pi compute modules. The rack is designed to be printed in two pieces and connected together using a dove tail joint design. This rack should fit any 19 inch rack designed for servers. Each piece should fit on most print beds measuring 256mm x 256mm x 256mm or 10 inches x 10 inches x 10 inches.
