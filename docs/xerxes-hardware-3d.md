# Heatsinks, Racks, & Cases

### Cases and Racks

We are committed to trasnparency and open source for all case designs for the Xerxes Pi including our 1U mini rack, single Xerxes Pi enclosure, and full 19" 1U pro rack. All rack designs will be engineered to fit in a typically sized commercial 3D printer. All prints can either be bought by us pre-printed, printed on your own home printer, or printed by any of our print-farm partners.

### Heatsinks

[TCPolyÂ®](https://tcpoly.com) kindly provided their Ice9 heat conductive filament for internal testing at RapidAnalysis during our custom heatsink development trials. We found that their Nylon and TPU filament worked really well with CM4 and CM5 custom heatsinks. We will be providing both TCPoly and traditional aluminium heatsinks as custom passive cooling sleds used to friction fit Xerxes Pis in our custom designed open source 1U mini-rack and full sized rack enclosures.
