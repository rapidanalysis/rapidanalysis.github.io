# Heatsinks

[TCPoly®](https://tcpoly.com) kindly provided their Ice9 heat conductive filament for internal testing at RapidAnalysis during our custom heatsink development trials. We found that their Nylon and TPU filament worked really well with CM4 and CM5 custom heatsinks. We will be providing both TCPoly and traditional aluminium heatsinks as custom passive cooling sleds used to friction fit Xerxes Pis in our custom designed open source 1U mini-rack and full sized rack enclosures.
