# Getting Started

These pages contain code examples for querying the RapidAnalysis API. All queries use JSON in the request body to return a response from the server using POST. 

::: details What is an API?
APIs serve as the bridge that enables seamless communication and data exchange between different software systems, allowing them to work together harmoniously. 
For more information about what an API can do, please see: https://weburban.com/2023/09/21/what-is-an-api-how-does-it-work/
:::

::: tip
All calls require your own unique secret key, set as `x-api-key` in the request header.
